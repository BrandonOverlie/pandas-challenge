## Observable Trends

1 - So two things when looking at the top 5 performing schools vs the bottom 5 performing schools. The Top 5 are all Charter Schools, and all have student populations less than the Bottom 5 Schools. Also, the Bottom 5 Schools are all District Schools. Interestingly, budget per student seems to have a negative correlation with test scores. This means that the more money spent per student, the less likely that student is to pass their test (there are likely multiple factors to explain this phenomenon and the relationship should not be assumed to be a causal relationship).

2 - It should also be noted that no matter how the data is filtered, students tend to do better at the reading test then the math test.
